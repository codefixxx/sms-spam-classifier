# 📩 SMS Spam Detection

A machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as **spam** or **ham** using natural language processing (NLP) and a supervised learning model.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses a real-world dataset of SMS messages to build a spam detection system. It involves data cleaning, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and classification using the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** algorithm.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

- **Text preprocessing** (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopwords removal)
- **Feature extraction** using **TF-IDF vectorization**
- **Classification** using **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
- **Model evaluation** via confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is a collection of ~5,500 SMS messages labeled as either `spam` or `ham`.  
It was originally sourced from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection).
